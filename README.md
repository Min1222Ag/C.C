# ü§ñ 2022 Purdue Beach Cleaning Robot by TEAM C.C

+ **Project Title**

Post Emergency Power Management for IoT based Precision Agriculture Irrigation System
Using Cost-Effective Algorithm and Serverless        

+ **Problem Statement**
    
    In 2016, the United States was responsible for 42 million metric tons of plastic waste, which made it the largest contributor in the world. The U.S is also ranked 3rd in the world when it comes to depositing pollution onto its own shorelines. There is an estimated 95,000 miles of shoreline in the United States as well as an estimated 90,000 beaches across the country. To say pollution and waste are an issue for the beaches, is an understatement.
    
    Litter on the beaches affect not only water, but also the wildlife, local residents, and even the economic state of the area. Trash can make living conditions for any living organism, unsuitable. This happens when a turtle mistakes a plastic bag as a jellyfish, causing the turtle to consume the trash because jellyfish are a part of a turtle's diet. When pollution infects a beach, it makes it look unpleasant, which in turn would turn off tourists from wanting to visit the beach while also potentially making local residents want to move from the area. These two instances combined can have a devastating impact on the economy as tourism is a significant portion of the U.S's economy. 
    
    There is no easy solution to this problem, however the development of a self-driving robot that can gather and dispose of trash on its own is a good start.

+ **Novelty**

    1. Develop the existing simple algorithm's concept!
       => 
      
    2. Use LoRa, LoRaWAN with Serverless(FaaS)!
       => 


+ **System Overview**

</p>
    
    1. Tomatoes were planted in 4 areas, each with a soil moisture sensor and irrigation tube installed.
    
    2. The crop data is transmitted to the gateway through LoRa communication.
    
    3. The gateway sends the crop data to the Cloud through LoRaWAN communication.
    
    4. When the crop data arrives at the Cloud, store it in the database and apply the devised algorithm.
    
    5. The Cloud sends the irrigation command to the gateway.
    
    6. The irrigation command arrives at the Arduino which operates the irrigation system.
