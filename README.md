## ü§ñ 2022 Purdue Beach Cleaning Robot by TEAM C.C


#### üåä Project Title

    Developmental Process and Application of an Eco-Friendly, Autonomous Beach-Cleaning Robot

#### üåä Problem Statement
    
      Trash that beach-goers throw away and has been washed up by natural disasters contribute to beach pollution. Beach pollution is
    harmful to the wildlife that lives on the beach, the residents, tourists, and especially the beach itself. Beach pollution is
    an issue for coastal area economies due to the fact that pollution deters tourism; marine pollution is a problem in many coastal
    areas of the United States as it affects tourism and recreation which contributes approximately $124 billion in gross domestic
    product.
    
      ABCbot has the power and capability to rid beaches of pollution by itself. ABCbot automatically drives using GPS which
    means that it minimizes human interference and clears a wider range. In addition, the idea of employing ABCbot instead of humans
    or other types of robots makes the beach cleaning process more efficient and cost-effective.
    
      After all, those expected effects mean that ABCbot is able to broaden the usage of robots in an eco-friendly area.

#### üåä Novelty

    The first Autonomous driving Beach Cleaning Robot with designated GPS tracking!
       => ABCbot is possible to clean the beach while avoiding obstacles over a wide range.
      
    Optimized robot for detect the obstacles in real time!
       => By combining RPLiDAR and proximity sensors to examine the distance from the ABCbot in real time, it can detects
          obstacles in front of the robot.

    An Eco-friendly robot!

    1. One raspberry pi 4B is used for the driving unit equipping magnetometer sensor, DC motors relay, GPS, and proximity sensors.
    
    2. Another raspberry pi 4B is utilized as a detection unit arming LiDAR and proximity sensor.
    
    3. Two raspberry pi 4Bs communicate with each other through ROS2 Foxy.
    
    4. All the raspberry pi 4Bs and sensors have power supplied by a solar panel.
    
    
#### üåä Flow Chart

</p>

    1.  Until the ABCbot button is pushed again, it keeps running and the terminating order is the reverse order of starting order.
    
    2. There are two raspberry pi, one for driving control(RPi 1) and the other for obstacle detection(RPi 2).
    
    3-1. RPi 1 drives the robot following GPS coordinates while the proximity sensors detect nothing.
    
    3-2. If the proximity sensors attached to RPi 1 detect the obstacle, RPi 1 stops driving and waits for a signal from RPi 2.
    
    3-3. After receiving a signal from RPi 2, it resumes moving as avoiding an obstacle or not according to the type of the signal; driving or avoiding.
    
    4-1. RPi 2 takes charge of accurate obstacle detection and it starts with a proximity sensor and a LiDAR.
    
    4-2. If they detect an obstacle, RPi 2 sends an avoiding signal. Otherwise, RPi 2 sends a driving signal.

#### üåä Installation

   1. [ROS 2 foxy](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html)

   2. [Creating a workspace](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-A-Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html)
   
   3. go to [üí°Detectionüí°](#detection)

   4. Set same ROS_DOMAIN_ID on both pi </br>

    $ export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=[your_own_id]
    $ source /opt/ros/your_ros2_distribution/setup.bash
    
   5. Set the environment variables  
   
    $ cd [the directory you've cloned the code at]/C.C/test  
    $ source set_env.sh
    
#### üí°Detectionüí°

##### 1. create interfaces package </br>
    $ ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_cmake interfaces

##### 2. download [requirements1.txt](requirements1.txt)
    $ pip install -r requirements1.txt
##### 3. install rplidar ROS2 onto Raspberry Pi  
    $ cd ~
    $ sudo apt install ros-foxy-rplidar-ros
    $ source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
    $ ros2 run rplidar_ros rplidar_composition ‚Äìros-args -p serial_port:=/dev/ttyUSB0 -p frame_id:=laser_frame -p angle_compensate:=true -p scan_mode:=Standard
